# 🇮🇳 India CPI Inflation Analysis & Economic Impact Study

### **Project Overview**

This project analyzes India's **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** data to decode inflation trends, sector-specific contributions, and the economic impact of global events like the COVID-19 pandemic and crude oil price fluctuations.

Using historical data, the study breaks down inflation behavior across key categories—such as **Food, Energy, and Healthcare**—to understand how the cost of living has evolved for Indian households from 2017 to 2023.

### **🎯 Problem Statements & Analysis**

This case study addresses **5 critical economic questions**:

1. **Category Contribution:**
* Identified the weightage of broad categories (Food, Energy, Transportation) in the overall CPI basket for the latest month.
* Determined which specific category holds the highest contribution to the headline inflation number.


2. **Year-on-Year (YoY) CPI Trend:**
* Analyzed the YoY growth rate of combined (Rural + Urban) CPI from **2017 onwards**.
* Plotted annual growth rates to pinpoint the year with the highest inflation and investigated the macroeconomic reasons behind the spike.


3. **Food Price Volatility (Last 12 Months):**
* Examined Month-on-Month (MoM) changes in the food basket for the 12 months ending **May 2023**.
* Identified the peak and trough months for food inflation and isolated the specific sub-category driving these fluctuations.


4. **COVID-19 Impact Assessment:**
* Compared inflation trends **Pre-March 2020 vs. Post-March 2020**.
* Specifically assessed the price impact on **Healthcare, Food, and Essential Services** during the pandemic phases.


5. **Global Events & Oil Price Correlation:**
* Investigated the relationship between **Imported Crude Oil Prices (2021–2023)** and India’s domestic inflation.
* Analyzed the correlation between global oil price shocks and inflation in transport and energy-dependent categories.

### **💡 Key Insights**

* **Food Dominance:** The "Food & Beverage" category remains the most significant contributor to the CPI basket, making headline inflation highly sensitive to agricultural supply shocks.
* **Pandemic Shift:** Post-March 2020 data shows a distinct structural shift in **Healthcare** inflation, which remained elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels.
* **Energy Sensitivity:** A strong positive correlation was observed between global crude oil prices and the "Transport & Communication" CPI sector, confirming imported inflation risks.
